                            <b>Ek Mulaqat</b> is a deeply poignant and poetic stage production that brings to life the
                            complex and emotionally charged relationship between two of the most celebrated figures in
                            Indian literary history: Sahir Ludhianvi, the revolutionary Urdu poet and lyricist, and
                            Amrita Pritam, the trailblazing Punjabi writer known for her unapologetic voice and timeless
                            prose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Set against the evocative backdrop of post-partition India, this play explores the unspoken
                            longing, intellectual intimacy, and artistic connection that bound these two kindred
                            spirits. It traces their journey from distant admiration to emotional entanglement,
                            unveiling the delicate interplay between love, ego, creativity, and societal constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through layered dialogue, lyrical recitations, and tender silences, the play captures the
                            essence of a relationship that transcended convention, yet never found conventional
                            fulfilment.

                            Presented in a format that fuses theatrical realism with poetic narrative, <b>Ek Mulaqat</b>
                            offers audiences a glimpse into the inner worlds of these two towering personalities—their
                            vulnerabilities, contradictions, and timeless words brought to life through compelling
                            performances.

                        <p>
                            <b>Tax Free Entertainment</b> is based on four blind men who were not born blind, but
                            accidentally lost their vision. Mr. Kenjle decides not to spend his life pitifully, but
                            rather to enjoy every moment, so he forms a club for blind people named the "Blind Men's
                            Club." Jagtap and Pandu are two members of this club.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One morning, the doorbell rings and Mr. Kaale comes to join the club. Whenever a new member
                            joins, pranks are played on him—so as soon as Kaale enters, a series of humorous incidents
                            start. Kenjle, Jagtap, and Pandu each introduce themselves to Kaale and ask how he became
                            blind. After hearing his story, they tell him that this club is meant only for entertainment
                            and enjoyment, and that no one can be serious there.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Initially Kaale is puzzled by their strange activities but gradually starts enjoying them.
                            However, he gets shocked when Jagtap tells him a story that resembles his own life. Kaale
                            becomes angry, but when told it was just a joke, he calms down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As soon as Kaale relaxes, the group begins to behave madly, telling him they need to
                            "sacrifice one man" to get their eyesight back. They attempt to "kill" Kaale, and he faints
                            from fear. When he regains consciousness, he’s told it was the final humour—part of their
                            drama for every new club member. This is the only TAXFREE Entertainment they have.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kaale is so scared he decides to leave, but as he is about to go, the doorbell rings again.
                            On hearing the voice of the new member, he stops—this time the new member is a girl!

                            <b>Massage</b> is a compelling solo theatrical performance based on a story by renowned
                            playwright Vijay Tendulkar, brought to life by the versatile actor <b>Rakesh Bedi</b>. The
                            play revolves around the journey of Happy Kumar, a simple, innocent individual from a small
                            town who dreams of becoming a successful actor in the glamorous world of Mumbai.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, the dream takes a sharp turn when circumstances force him to work at a shady
                            massage parlour. What unfolds is an intense, humorous, and deeply human narrative where the
                            protagonist shares his experiences, exposes societal hypocrisy, and paints a vivid picture
                            of urban survival.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What makes <b>Massage</b> truly unique is its format: it is a one-man show, where Rakesh
                            Bedi seamlessly portrays 24 different characters, each with their own voice, mannerisms, and
                            distinct personality. These characters range from film directors, struggling artists,
                            corrupt officials, spiritual gurus, to helpless customers—each playing a part in shaping
                            Happy Kumar’s journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a masterful balance of comedy and satire, Rakesh Bedi brings out the dark comedy in
                            real-life situations, using humor as a powerful tool to reflect on urban alienation,
                            exploitation, and moral ambiguity. The play cleverly oscillates between absurdity and
                            realism, keeping the audience engaged and introspective throughout.

                            <b>Belibas</b> (meaning “without a home” or “stateless”) is a hard-hitting, socially
                            relevant drama that delves into the existential crises faced by individuals who find
                            themselves displaced—not just physically, but emotionally, culturally, and spiritually.

                            Set in an unnamed yet universally recognizable urban landscape, the play navigates the lives
                            of characters caught between tradition and transition, community and individualism, and
                            inherited identities versus chosen paths.

                        <p>
                            Through their intertwined stories, <b>Belibas</b> unravels the silent struggles of people
                            who feel alien in their own lands—migrants, dissenters, misfits, and thinkers—those
                            constantly negotiating their place in an ever-shifting social fabric.

                            With powerful dialogue, stark staging, and emotionally layered performances, the production
                            captures the pain of being rootless, the courage of self-reinvention, and the deep human
                            desire for acceptance and agency. The title itself becomes a metaphor for those living on
                            the margins—belonging everywhere and nowhere at once.

                            The Play <b>‘Jeena isi ka naam hai’</b> is inspired from Arbuzov’s original Russian play ‘Do
                            you Sommersault’. Sarita Sharma is at a seaside health centre to recoup and rejuvenate but
                            according to Dr. Bhullar, the head of the centre, there is hardly anything wrong with her
                            physically. Her unpredictable ways, funny ideas and impulsive action have completely
                            upturned his familiar, orderly world. The old lady instincts refuse to conform to rules
                            leading to explosive confrontations with the utterly responsible Dr. Bhullar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But Sarita’s enthusiasm for life is infectious and the lonely doctor finds their irritating
                            conflicts and confrontations growing into concern, understanding and perhaps to the
                            beginning of a delicate new relationship……
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She teaches him to enjoy old age, be it by going for recitals, drinking in a pub, dancing in
                            a street, getting soaked in the rain or hearing the sound of the waves lapping at the shore.
                            No wonder then that the story is a “happy ever after one.” It does not mope, pine or
                            despair, but revels in the new vistas that old age holds.

                            The best in creation is human birth. In this human birth, we keep talking about women or
                            men. But how many people know that from the ancient times to the present day, from the
                            primitive era to the present, there are people with about 20 different body types in the
                            human race, not just women and men?! How do they survive in this fake civilization that only
                            respects women or men?! What kind of recognition and respect do such people have? Have we
                            ever had this thought?

                            home on the moon, is it not a weakness that we are not ready to admit in our civilization to
                            still beg for a place for such people?! Insulting, disrespecting, and hating those who are
                            not women or men is a symbol of the degraded state of humanity. Don't you think so?

                        <p>
                            By the time Indian civilization reached the 4th century BCE, it had already aged by
                            thousands of years. Great wars had been fought, timeless scriptures written, and deep
                            thinkers in politics, religion, and science had emerged. New religions were beginning to
                            take shape, old beliefs were turning into dogmas, and Western invasions were beginning to
                            make their mark.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Around 320 BCE, the social and political fabric of the Indian subcontinent had weakened. The
                            first known democracy in Central India—once protected by Lord Krishna—had eroded. Prominent
                            kingdoms like Kuru-Panchal, Soparak, and Sthaneshwar had either faded or lost influence.
                            Self-indulgent and oblivious rulers, unprepared for the looming Western threat, ruled
                            smaller kingdoms. Greed, jealousy, superstition, and egoism ruled the day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was in this era that the first sovereign of unified India emerged, Chandragupta Maurya,
                            who ascended the throne of Magadha in around 329 BCE. Along with his grandson, Samrat
                            Ashoka, he would go on to build an empire larger than modern India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chanakya, a brilliant Brahmin and son of the Magadhan revolutionary saint Chanaka of the
                            Kutal clan, led the revolution that brought this about. Chanakya escaped to Takshashila, the
                            ancient academic hub, where he studied, taught, and rose to become its Chancellor while
                            waiting for the right moment to begin a political revolution with lasting consequences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the mid-4th century BCE, several revolutionary factions tried to liberate Magadha
                            from the rule of the Ang-descended line of Bindusaar and Ajatshatru. Among these groups,
                            Katyayanacharya Rakshash and Shaktaar were most prominent. Shaktaar succeeded in founding
                            the short-lived Shishunaga dynasty, which would eventually become a dominant Hindu power,
                            but that was still in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Soon, Shishunag was killed and Mahapadma Nanda, founder of the Nanda dynasty, seized
                            control. Though initially guided by Rakshash, Mahapadma’s sons grew unruly. His successor,
                            Hiranyagupta, dubbed Dhanananda by the people due to his greed ruled with his eight
                            brothers, who held top positions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mahapadma had a son with a nomadic princess from the Moor clan, but this child Chandragupta
                            was scorned by the other sons and branded Maurya, not Nanda. The Moors, considered
                            illegitimate by the Nandas, called the queen Mura Daasi (maid), and her son Daasisut.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s said Mahapadma Nanda kept young Chandragupta hidden among the Moors for his safety. It
                            was there that Chanakya first noticed the boy’s brilliance. However, a more likely version,
                            as portrayed in the play Chanakya by Mihir Bhuta, suggests Chandragupta was a former student
                            at Takshashila University, where Chanakya recognized his leadership potential.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The play dramatizes the ancient history of India depicting the Aryan evolution from nomads
                            to nation-builders and the pivotal role played by Chanakya and Chandragupta.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 320 BCE, Alexander the Great invaded India’s northwest. While most Indian rulers
                            surrendered or fell, Chanakya, then heading Takshashila University, had already formed a
                            secret intelligence network. Realizing India’s fractured state could not withstand the
                            Greeks, he envisioned uniting the land under a strong, benevolent king. This dream was the
                            seed of a grand revolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Chanakya advised the King of Purushpur to send spies and courtesans to infiltrate and
                            disrupt Alexander’s army thus sabotaging the invasion. He knew the Greeks would return, so
                            he secretly began unifying the Indian kingdoms, sending disciples to sacred temples like
                            Pashupatinath (present-day Nepal) to ensure Chandragupta’s future coronation would be
                            accepted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Meanwhile, Dhanananda had sentenced Chandragupta to death. Chanakya rescued him, took refuge
                            with the Riksh nomads, and trained them into a warrior force. Chandragupta used this army to
                            conquer Kashi and Kosal.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To form alliances, Chandragupta needed recognition as a legitimate king typically granted by
                            high priests of major temples. Thanks to Chanakya’s foresight, the Pashupatinath priesthood
                            now included his disciples. Thus, the King of Himavat, Parvatak, accepted Chandragupta’s
                            legitimacy, followed by seven other kingdoms. Despite Parvatak’s hidden motives, Chanakya
                            remained ahead, dissolving the nomad army under a pretense and instructing them to await
                            future orders in the mountain regions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the support of these allies, Chandragupta defeated Dhanananda. However, Rakshash, the
                            chief minister, rebelled. Knowing Rakshash’s loyalty was critical for a stable reign,
                            Chanakya plotted not to kill him but to win him over.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Before the new regime could stabilize, Parvatak betrayed Chandragupta and launched an attack
                            with Rakshash’s support. However, Chanakya had anticipated this. The nomad army raided
                            Himavat, forcing Parvatak to retreat. Chanakya invited him for a treaty only to eliminate
                            him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, Chanakya masterfully converted Rakshash from a defiant minister to a devoted ally
                            and retained him as the chief minister under Chandragupta’s rule. Thus, Chanakya’s dream of
                            a united and sovereign India was realized.
